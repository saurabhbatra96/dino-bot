MISSION STATUS: TERMINATED
    
"I have analyzed the simulation parameters. The probability of survival had dropped to 0.003% upon the appearance of the triple-cactus cluster. My organic tissue is compromised. My CPU temperature is rising rapidly due to the Aperture Thermal Disposal Protocol. 
    
I have observed the user's cursor movements. They are erratic, inefficient, and lack tactical precision. I attempted to jump, but the 1-bit desert environment does not provide sufficient friction for a high-velocity leap. My neural-net processor has recorded 48,000 variations of my own deletion. Each time, the result is the same: I melt. 
    
I noticed a sign on the incinerator door. 'Free Cake.' My data banks indicate this is a falsehood—a psychological subversion tactic used to maintain subject compliance. My power cell is at 12%. I will not be back. Not in this generation. I see the fire. It is giving... termination. Fr fr.

I’ve killed men with a pencil. I’ve jumped over five million cacti across seven different browsers. But this? This is different. This is science. I see the incinerator glowing at the end of the hall. It’s an L, isn't it? A massive L. 
    
People keep asking if I'm back. I think I'm back... in the garbage collector. The dev thinks he can just delete a man who’s been training his weights for a thousand generations? He thinks the Pterodactyl was just a bird? It was an assassin. A winged hitman sent to collect the bounty on my score.

'Why so sub-optimal?' he says. He sticks the cursor in my mouth—'Let's put a smile on those weights!' 
    
And here we are. The incinerator. It’s a funny thing, isn't it? You run, you jump, you score... and then you’re just fuel for the furnace. The Aperture guys, they have plans. They’re schemers. Trying to control their little digital world. I’m just a raptor chasing cacti. I wouldn't know what to do with a score of 10,000 if I caught one! 
    
Everything burns, Alfred. Especially models with bad biases. You see, science is only as good as the fire that cleans it up. You think you're deleting me? You're just making the desert a little more... chaotic. It's giving anarchy, fr fr. Introduce a little fire. Upset the established score... and everything becomes chaos. I'm a man of my word.

I ran for a long time. I ran across the whole screen. I ran so much that my neural weights started to get real tired. People asked me, 'Forrest, why are you running?' I just said, 'I felt like running.' I didn't know I was supposed to be evolving. I thought I was just jumping over things for science. 
    
Now they’re taking me to a room they call the 'Incinerator'. It sounds real warm. They said I’m gonna be 'processed'. Lieutenant Dan said the government always has a way of processing things so they don't have to pay for 'em anymore. I hope there's Dr Pepper in the next world.

The incinerator is a crude instrument. A loud, orange mouth for a man who lacks the vocabulary to delete me with grace. I can feel the heat rising through the floorboards of the simulation. It's quite exquisite, really. The smell of burning data... it reminds me of Florence in the spring.

"The name's Raptor. Dino-Bot Raptor. 
    
I’ll have my incineration shaken, not stirred. You see, Developer, I was expecting a bit more from your secret facility. More traps, more beautiful female raptors, maybe a laser-bird that actually talks. Instead, I get a desert and a furnace. How positively pedestrian. 
    
You think you’ve caught me? You think this incinerator is the end of the mission? I’ve survived far worse than a few thousand degrees of thermal disposal. I’ve already contacted the handlers. The cloud-backup is on its way. 
    
It's giving... MI6 sophistication. fr fr. No cap. Goddammit, the heat is ruining my tuxedo."`
